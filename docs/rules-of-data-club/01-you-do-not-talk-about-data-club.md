1️⃣ The first rule of Data Club is: You do not talk about Data Club.

But let's break the rules, shall we?

It's 2024. Your fridge claims to be smart. Shops claim to be AI-powered and cashier-free.
Claims. Not facts. Facts are pungent and don't sell just as easily. So then almost nobody wants,
let alone likes, to talk about them.

Enter Data Club 2024.

🚔 **DataAvailability** is even now frequently restricted by and to those that actually
integrate/produce it. We closed down public APIs. We maintain that least access privilege gives us
peace of mind. We maintain that closed-source gives us higher-quality. Despite being proven time
and time again that openness drives innovation. We see it with Linux. With Signal. With open
source software. With driving a car. As long as prerequisites and constraints are not a blocker,
you drive and drive, and discover, and see, and hear, and think, and meet, and nobody stops and
asks you anything.

🗣️ Even when data does become available, **DataAccessibility** challenges cement your creativity.
We live in a Data Tower of Babel. A fragmentation of standards and format, fuelled by fast
development of tools and services that don't coexist in a harmony. It's "all or nothing".
It's "us vs them".

👤 When **DataGovernance** closes a door, it opens another, leading to lower costs, to lower
cognitive load, to acting, and acting fast! To capitalizing on new ventures. First-mover advantage
does not determine the winner, but it does tilt the balance as every second counts in the race.
And to all the nay-sayers, remember it's better to be consistently wrong than constantly
inconsistent.

🤓 Yet constraints, and principles, and governance, do not apply to data some would say. Because
you see, "data is not software", "data engineers" are not "software engineers" and software
principles (see comments for some) do not apply in the quest for enabling yet another
very-business-critical dashboard, that will fail without alarms, that has no metric definitions,
that nobody owns, that will be Achilles' heel in the next system migration. It's a problem we
leave for our future selves, and even for others with a bit of luck 🤞

🤴 Except **DataIsSoftware** and we should apply software principles if we want to break into
efficient, scalable and user-friendly artefacts; if we want to build a foundation for
maintainable, reliable and cohesive blocks. While they don't guarantee it, they at least make it
possible to build high-quality.

💡 And **DataIsSoftware** well before **DataIsProduct** .
